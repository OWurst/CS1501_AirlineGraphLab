# CS1501_AirlineGraphLab
This project was for CS1501 at UPitt, Algorithms and Data Structures 2. The program creates an undirected graph for an airline by reading in the file AirlineData.txt, which is provided in this repository, or a similarly formatted file. Users then have options to print out graph data or plan a route, which they can rank by number of connections (hops), price, or distance. If anyone would like to create any sort of GUI for this app feel welcome to make a pull request.
